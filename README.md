# Linux Lab

Linux scripts and snippets.

## Ideas

Identity

- IPA server, likely needs something RHEL-based
- IPA client, more installable
- Possible alternative: kanidm could run on debian https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm
- Possible extension: Samba DC for Windows clients (can they log in to Linux accounts though?)

Config management

- Ansible & AWX

VDI

- GNOME remote desktop
- Guacamole?

VPN
- OpenVPN due to good authentication options.

Virtualization
- KVM
- Virt-install
- Proxmox

Applications
- Gitea
- A container host of some sort
- Backups

Provisioning

- Debian pre-seed
- Kickstart
- cloud-init
